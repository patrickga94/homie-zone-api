# express-auth-template

A template for starting projects with `express` as an API. Includes
authentication and common middlewares.

## Installation

1. [Download](../../archive/master.zip) this template.
1. Move the .zip file to your `sei/projects/` directory and Unzip it (creating a
   folder) -- **NOTE:** if the folder was already unzipped, use the `mv` command
   line to move it to the `sei/projects/` directory.
1. Rename the directory from express-auth-template -> your-app-name.
1. Rename [`README.md`](README.md) to `REF.md` and use as a reference, create a new README and fill with your own content.
1. Move into the new project and `git init`.
1. Replace all instances of `'express-auth-template'` with your app name.
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Ensure that you have `nodemon` installed by running `npm install -g nodemon`.
2. Once everything is working, make an initial commit.

## API

Use this as the basis for your own API documentation. Add a new third-level
heading for your custom entities, and follow the pattern provided for the
built-in user authentication documentation.

Scripts are included in [`curl-scripts`](curl-scripts) to test built-in actions. Feel free to use Postman for testing, using the curl scripts listed below and in the folder for setting up headers and request bodies.
Add your own scripts to test your custom API.
